Unity Workspace Setup Instructions
----------------------------------

1. Create a folder somewhere on your desktop to store the project files in for easy access to source files and assets

2. Name the folder something obvious like "CSI 2999 2D Unity Game" so you don't forget what's in it or accidentally delete it

3. Open GitHub desktop and at the top of the window click File -> Clone Repository... -> URL and then enter the following into the URL field:

        https://github.com/VincentVenetta/CSI-2999-Group-Project.git

4. Click local path and navigate to the folder you created on your desktop, for the sake of example CSI 2999 2D Unity Game, and click select folder

5. Click clone

6. At the top of GitHub desktop switch Current branch from main to development

7. Click fetch origin

8. Open Unity Hub

9. At the top right of Unity Hub click the arrow next to NEW

10. Ensure that the version of Unity you're using is version 2021.1.16f1

11. If the Unity version is correct click NEW

12. Under template, click 2D Game

13. Name the project something identifiable, though this is technically unimportant and can be skipped

14. Choose the path to be the folder you created on your desktop earlier, ex. "C:\Users\vince\Desktop\CSI 2999 2D Unity Game"

15. Click create and allow Unity to setup the workspace for you (this may take a while depending on your hardware)

16. Close the Unity project you created once it opens

17. Now, in the desktop folder you created there should be two sub-folders, one titled "CSI-2999-Group-Project", and the other whatever you named your 2D Unity template

18. Open the Unity 2D template folder

19. Select all the files contained in the 2D template folder, press CTRL+C or right click them and press copy

20. Go back to the main folder and open CSI-2999-Group-Project

21. Press CTRL+V or right click inside the folder and press paste

22. When prompted to replace or skip files, choose skip for all

23. You may now delete the Unity 2D Game template you created and remove it from Unity Hub by pressing the three dots on the right of the project name

24. In Unity Hub, click the ADD button next to the NEW button in the top right corner

25. Select the CSI-2999-Group-Project folder

26. Click select folder and then the project name to open it
